# PowerShell_Deobfuscation

## Overview
This repository contains small PowerShell scripts designed to assist with deobfuscating various encoded or obfuscated elements found in PowerShell scripts. These scripts aim to simplify analysis by converting obfuscated values back into their readable form.

## Purpose
Obfuscation is commonly used to evade detection and hinder analysis. This repo provides quick and effective ways to deobfuscate elements such as:
- Decimal-encoded strings
- Hex-encoded values
- Base64-encoded data
- Other common obfuscation techniques used in malicious PowerShell scripts
